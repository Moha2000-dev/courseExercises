## Code Structure

- Each function is implemented as a static method.
- The main menu loop keeps the program running until the user exits.
- The program uses `Console.ReadLine()` to take user input and `Console.WriteLine()` to display outputs.

## Example Functionality

### Even and Odd Numbers in an Array
This feature allows the user to:
- Input an array length.
- Enter numbers into the array.
- Separate even and odd numbers into different arrays.
- Display the separated numbers to the user.

Example output:
```
Please enter the length of the array: 5
Please enter the number: 10
Please enter the number: 5
Please enter the number: 8
Please enter the number: 7
Please enter the number: 3
The odd numbers are 3: 5, 7, 3
The even numbers are 2: 10, 8
```
